QUESTION 2 â€“ EXERCISE 1.11 PAGE  31
(Population projection) The U.S. Census Bureau projects population based on the following assumptions:
* One birth every 7 seconds
* One death every 13 seconds
* One new immigrant every 45 seconds
Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years. Assume the current population is 312,032,486 and one year has 365 days.
Hint: In Java, if two integers perform division, the result is an integer. The fractional part is truncated.
For example, 5 / 4 is 1 (not 1.25) and 10 / 4 is 2 (not 2.5). To get an accurate result with the fractional part,
one of the values involved in the division must be a number with a decimal point. For example, 5.0 / 4 is 1.25 and 10 / 4.0 is 2.5.
