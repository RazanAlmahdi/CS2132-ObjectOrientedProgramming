/*
(The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes)
Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee.
A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address.
A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior).
Define the status as a constant.
An employee has an office, salary, and date hired.
Use the Date class to create an object for date hired.
A faculty member has office hours and a rank.
A staff member has a title.
Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name. 
Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them.
Write a test pro- gram that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and invokes their toString() methods.
