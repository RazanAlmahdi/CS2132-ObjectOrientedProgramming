QUESTION 3 â€“ EXERCISE 9.13 PAGE 364
12. (The Location class) Design a class named Location for locating a maximal value and its location in a twodimensional array. The class contains public data fields row, column, and maxValue that store the maximal value 
and its indices in a two-dimensional array with row and column as int types and maxValue as a double type. 
Write the following method that returns the location of the largest element in a two-dimensional array:
public static Location locateLargest(double[][] a) 
The return value is an instance of Location. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a two-dimensional 
array and displays the location of the largest element in the array.
